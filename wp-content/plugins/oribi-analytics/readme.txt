We value your privacy and the privacy of your website visitors, and we make sure that you can continue serving your EU customers worry-free.

Oribi collects only aggregated, fully anonymous data.

By default, we do not save any personal data, such as email addresses or exact locations of your visitors. Visitors in the Visitor Journeys are displayed with an automatically assigned number. That being said, no information can be connected to a specific individual.

In addition to this, you can also exclude specific IP addresses. In this case, Oribi will not track any action from this visitor at all.
