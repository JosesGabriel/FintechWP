		<h2>ARBITRAGE COMMUNITY GUIDELINES</h2>


		<p>Rich and intellectual debate is amazing. It can spark the furthering of the financial literacy topic into becoming a national discussion, reaching a far wider deeper audience. Forums like these can transcend a nation into a different level, a community of well-informed and financially literate citizenry. And, while debates are wonderful, it can be ugly too. It can be if we allow other people abuse things and bring topics outside of its core discourse. So here, we highly encourage everyone to do these in manners that are not offensive, humiliating or intimidating. We will not tolerate discrimination based on: ethnicity, physical characteristics, gender or sexual orientation, religion or non-religious viewpoints (i.e. secular humanism, atheism), political opinion, socio-economic status, age, physical, mental or intellectual aptitude and the ways people express themselves. Remember that we are gunning for a national Financial Literacy community, under a different sub-national ethnic cultures.</p>

		<p>For our community to remain enjoyable, inspiring and safe one for all our users, tet us implore basic courtesy and respect. We reserve the right to remove posts are considered likely to disrupt, provoke, attack or offend others, post that are racist, sexist, homophobic, sexually explicit, abusive or otherwise objectionable contain swear words or other languages likely to offend break the law or condone or encourage unlawful activity.</p>

		<p>Here are some of dos and don’ts and the general stuff you need to understand.</p>

		<p><strong>KEEP IT LEGAL.</strong> We’ll delete posts that are unlawful. Such activities may include financial solicitation in exchange of an investment advice; performing a quasi-educational operations by individuals or entities with no proper permits from the SEC, PSE & other regulators, collecting extraordinary charges for financial literacy and/or investment seminars, workshops and other related activities & fund management scheme from people not duly deputized and authorized The Philippine Stock Exchange and other regulators.</p>

		<p><strong>KEEP IT CLEAN.</strong>Strong language has no place here. Profanities and creative alternatives will be deleted at sight.</p>
	
		<p><strong>KEEP IT RELEVANT.</strong> This is a Stock Trading & Financial Literacy website. We can’t support off-topic discussions especially if it is a far out topic.</p>

		<p><strong>KEEP IT RESPECTFUL.</strong> Arbitrage is proud of hosting a national community of Stock Traders & Financial Practitioners that embraces different sub-national cultures, faiths, attitudes and points of view. Please be respectful of this.</p>

		<p><strong>DONT FEED A TROLL.</strong> Trolls post messages or content deliberately designed to get the blood boiling. Replying to or arguing with a troll is feeding. The best pest-control is to ignore, and use the flag to let us know about them so we can deal with it. Trolling is a prevalent culture present in amongst retail traders. It may take awhile to bring them over the real side. For now, let us just manage their behaviours. </p>
